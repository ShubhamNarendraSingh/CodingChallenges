Used Java Programming Language to Solve these problems
Insights of logic thinking for each problem

* **Problem 1**: Multiple operations to perform on two digit to make a calculator so switching the operator with switch case implementation
  
* **Problem 2**: The mathematical logic is the odd number to be printed deduced with sample input with a formula for
oddNumber = 2*x+1.

* **Problem 3**: A variation of Problem 2 with a prior check of given input x is even or odd based on that the count changes i.e. for even count = x - 1 and for odd count = x similarly the oddNumber = 2 * count + 1 formula remains same.
  
* **Problem 4**: This problem ask for checking multiples of given number in array checking from 1 to 9 and storing in a dictionary form with each multiple counts as value and numbers 1 to 9 as key. In java dictionary implementation is done by HashMap<Key, Value> pair. Checked the remainder by dividing with each value if it comes to 0 for respective number 1 to 9 it's count value is updated by +1 in HashMap named multiplesMap.
